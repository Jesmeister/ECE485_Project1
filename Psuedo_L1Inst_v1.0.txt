L1 Instruction Cache

Receive incoming address request

	Split address request into two variables

		Req_Index = lower 20 bits of address request

		Tag = upper 12 bits of address request 

		ReadWrite = part of address request ( can be 2-read, 3-invalidate, 8-clear, 9-print) 


	Case ( ReadWrite ) 

		Case  (2) 
			
			increment CacheREAD to keep track of number of reads 
	
			Cache_index = pointer to base address of index array

			Cache_index = Cache_index + Req_Index 

			If MSB of Cache_index[i] is 1(or true) data is valid
				Then compare Tags
					If Tags match 
						Increment CacheHIT to keep track of # of hits
						then read data
			
					else tags don't match
						Increment CacheMISS to keep track of # of misses
						then send current indexed data from L1 to L2. 
						Request new data from L2 and load into L1	
		
				Else MSB of Cache_index[i] is 0(or false) data is invalid
					Increment CacheMISS		
					Then Request data from L2
	

		Case (3)


		Case (8)
			Then for loop through Cache_index[] until end of array
				Clear
			end loop
	
		Case(9) 
			Print cacheREAD			Print cacheHIT				Print cacheMISS
			Print cacheHIT/(cacheMISS + cacheHIT)

end Case
